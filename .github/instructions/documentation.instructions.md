# Project documentation guidelines:

1. **Documentation Structure**
   - All project documentation must be organized in the `docs` folder, divided into two subfolders: `public` and `private`.

2. **Public Documentation (`docs/public`)**
   - Intended for external use and API consumers.
   - Must include:
     - API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, error handling, and usage examples.
     - Any information relevant for integration with other systems or external users.
   - Organize content by topics and context, using folders and files for clarity.

3. **Private Documentation (`docs/private`)**
   - Intended for internal use and project maintainers.
   - Must include:
     - System architecture, workflows, setup instructions, repository migration, secrets/tokens configuration, permissions, internal commands, and tool usage.
     - Any information about internal functionality, configuration, and maintenance.
   - Organize content by topics and context, using folders and files for clarity.

4. **Documentation Maintenance**
   - Documentation must always reflect the current state of the project.
   - When creating documentation for the first time, ensure it covers all relevant aspects of the system.
   - When updating, review changes in the system and update documentation accordingly.

5. **README Summary**
   - After completing or updating documentation, add a concise summary of the system and documentation structure to the `README.md` for quick reference.

6. **Organization and Clarity**
   - Maintain clear, organized, and well-structured documentation in both public and private folders.
   - Divide content logically by subject and context for easy navigation and understanding.

7. **Language**
   - All documentation must be written in technical English, unless otherwise specified.
