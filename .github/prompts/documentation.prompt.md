Documentation maintenance routine:

1. Check if the `docs/private` and `docs/public` folders exist.
2. If either folder is missing:
   - Analyze the entire system and its current state.
   - Create the missing documentation folders and files, covering all relevant topics as per the guidelines.
3. If both folders exist:
   - Review the current documentation in both folders.
   - Analyze the current system state and identify any changes or new features.
   - Update the documentation to reflect all modifications, additions, or removals in the system.
4. Organize documentation by topics and context, using folders and files for clarity.
5. After completing or updating documentation, add a concise summary of the system and documentation structure to the `README.md` for quick reference.
6. All documentation must be written in technical English.
